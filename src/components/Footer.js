            With more than 850 restaurants nationwide, we recognize our unique position to help provide
            hunger relief in the local communities we serve. In 2003, we created our Harvest program, where
            all restaurants gather wholesome, surplus food every day and carefully prepare for a weekly
            donation to a local non-profit organization. Olive Garden restaurants have donated over 40
            million pounds of food, and we also partner with Feeding AmericaÂ® to help children and
            families facing hunger in our communities.
